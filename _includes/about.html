<p>libtrancevibe is an open source, cross platform driver for the <A HREF='http://www.wilddivine.com'>Rez Trancevibrator</A> and compatible devices. The driver allows the developer to control the speed of the Trance Vibrator in a platform independant way.</p>
<p>Note: Outside of finding it on eBay, the original TranceVibrator is no longer available. We recommend the <A HREF='http://tim.cexx.org/projects/vibe/buyone.htm'>Drmn Trance Vibrator</A>, which is protocol compatible with libtrancevibe.</p>
